### To use the files, download and upload into Jupyter Hub to use the functions.
### To use extract_parameter, you will need a dictionary containing the unit name, parameter name, and indexed values. The function will search for the desired unit and desired parameter then return the value for the specified index number. If the unit, parameter, or index value is not valid, 'Invalid input' will be returned.
### To use calculate_solution_weights, you will need to input two lists. The first list, molecular_weights, must include the molecular formula:molecular weight, with each entry separated by commas. The second list must include molecular formula-desired concentration, with each entry separated by commas. The function will delimit the solutions_needed list into the molecular formula and the concentration. It will search for the molecular formula in the molecular_weights list. If found, it will multiply the solution concentration by the respective molecular weight and return a list entry containing 'molecular formula-solution concentration-weight'. If the molecular formula is not found, the list entry will return 'unknown' instead.
